Welcome to my learning repository! 🚀

This GitHub repo is a personal log of my backend development journey, where I'm exploring core concepts like SQL, data handling, routing, and server-side templating. I'm using this space to keep track of my progress, share my notes, and build small projects as I go.

🎯 What I'm Learning

Here's a breakdown of the topics I'm currently working on:

📦 Backend Tools & Packages
MySQL Package: Working with MySQL through Node.js.
Using SQL from CLI: Directly interacting with MySQL through the command line.
🗄️ Database Operations
CREATE Table user: Creating tables and understanding schemas.
INSERT INTO user: Inserting data manually into a MySQL table.
Insert in Bulk: Efficiently inserting multiple records at once.
Using Faker: Populating databases with fake user data for testing.
🌐 Routing & Server Setup
Routing: Introduction to route handling in a backend application.
Home Route / Show / Edit / Update Routes: Creating and managing various endpoints for a user-based app.
Add Template: Dynamically rendering views using templating engines.
🧠 Why I'm Doing This

Learning by building and documenting is my approach. This repo helps me:

Retain what I learn
Share resources and notes with others
Track my progress over time
📚 Next Steps

Add CRUD operations with validation
Integrate an authentication system
Connect backend to a frontend (React or plain HTML/CSS)
