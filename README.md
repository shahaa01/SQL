Welcome to my learning repository! 🚀

This GitHub repo is a personal log of my backend development journey, where I'm exploring core concepts like SQL, data handling, routing, and server-side templating. I'm using this space to keep track of my progress, share my notes, and build small projects as I go.

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

### 📦 Backend Tools & Packages
- **MySQL Package** – Working with MySQL through Node.js.
- **Using SQL from CLI** – Directly interacting with MySQL through the command line.

### 🗄️ Database Operations
- **CREATE Table user** – Creating tables and understanding schemas.
- **INSERT INTO user** – Inserting data manually into a MySQL table.
- **Insert in Bulk** – Efficiently inserting multiple records at once.
- **Using Faker** – Populating databases with fake user data for testing.

### 🌐 Routing & Server Setup

- **Home Route / Show / Edit / Update Routes** – Creating and managing various endpoints for a user-based app.
- **Add Template** – Dynamically rendering views using templating engines.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

Learning by building and documenting is my approach. This repo helps me:
- Retain what I learn
- Share resources and notes with others
- Track my progress over time

## 📚 Next Steps

- Add CRUD operations with validation
- Integrate an authentication system
- Connect backend to a frontend (React or plain HTML/CSS)
